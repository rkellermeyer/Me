# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  My name is Richard Kellermeyer, and I'm a firm believer that technology should simplify our lives, not complicate them. As an Application Architect with a wealth of experience, I've seen the transformative power of well-crafted software. I'm dedicated to leading teams towards creating solutions that are both innovative and user-friendly. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you'll likely find me whipping up something in the kitchen. I'm excited to connect and share my expertise with you!
