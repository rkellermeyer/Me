# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi, I'm Richard Kellermeyer, an Application Architect with a passion for using technology to simplify and improve our lives. With over 20 years in the industry, I've seen the impact well-crafted software can have on businesses of all sizes.  My experience spans the full spectrum, from architecting large-scale enterprise platforms to building user-friendly marketing websites.
