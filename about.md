## About Me
I am Richard Kellermeyer, an experienced Application Architect with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. With over 20 years in professional development and management, and over 30 years honing the practices of effective, efficient software development, I have witnessed the good, the bad, and the unmentionable aspects of the industry.
Not only am I a master technological strategist, but I am also a developer advocate. I strive to balance the distinct lines between work and life, continually seeking ways to enhance all aspects of both. I am as comfortable in the C-Suite as I am in the trenches, bringing a unique blend of strategic insight and hands-on expertise to every project.
